- Iterator is a tool that can be applied for common needs when dealing with data in object oriented programming
- It is an object that produces each element of a container / data-structure one element at a time
- Does not update data, but only gives you each element

Two most common operations of an Interator:
- ++ : we are going to overload this operator so that this advances the iterator to thenext value
- * : we are going to overload this operator to return the element in the current node
