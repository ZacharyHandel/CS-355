This is the final project in my Data Structures and Algorithms Class. There are 2 other members working on this project (Zach West and Gavin Hopper).
Our tasks include the following:
- Impliment 3 new features to the Interactional Fiction Game Engine written by Dr. Daniel Ray.
- These features we are creating include a bag system, a UI system, and a combat system.
